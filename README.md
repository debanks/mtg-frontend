# Magic the Gathering: Arena Helper UI

This is a pet project of mine written in ReactJS that serves to help new Magic the Gathering Arena (an online card game) players learn how to play and evaluate cards and decks.
This is the ReactJS frontend for Magic the Gathering: Arena Helper (http://mtg.davisbanks.com).
This should be paired with my [mtg-backend](https://github.com/debanks/mtg-backend.git) for development.

## Installation

I don't expect this to be forked or used for its code, but if you wish to simple clone the project and run:

```
cd /path-to-the-project
npm install
npm start
```

This will run the project locally with the configuration in the `.env` file. If you wish to build the project to upload to a production environment, run:

```
npm build
```

And this will create a build folder using the environment set in `.env-prod`. A build folder is already included if you wish to just upload as is.
